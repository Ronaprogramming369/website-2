						<p class="pragraph">Web design is about crafting the visual and experiential aspects of a website, ensuring it is appealing and user-friendly. It's a creative process that merges aesthetics with functionality. Key areas include:

							Typography: Choosing fonts and sizes that enhance readability and style.
							Color Theory: Using harmonious colors to evoke emotions and align with branding.
							Layouts: Arranging elements for a balanced and intuitive flow.
							User Experience (UX): Designing for ease of navigation and accessibility.
							Responsive Design: Ensuring the website looks great on all devices.
							Modern web design often involves tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD, allowing designers to create prototypes before development.Web development is the technical process of building websites or applications. It has two major areas:

							Front-End Development: Handles everything the user interacts with directly, like menus, animations, and layouts, using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with frameworks such as React or Vue.js.
							Back-End Development: Manages the server, database, and application logic. It uses technologies like Node.js, Python, or PHP, and databases like MySQL or MongoDB.
							Full-Stack Development: Combines both front-end and back-end skills, creating complete web solutions.
